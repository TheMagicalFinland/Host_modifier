# Host_modifier

This application aims at providing assistance with "hosts" file on your PC and makes it somewhat easier than opening notepad and modifying it manually.

This is a side project of mine, and I got an idea to make this on 21.10.2022.

First decided to keep the code private, but decided to publish it so nobody thinks it's a malicious software that steals your data from the pc.

If you can't compile the program yourself, there is a ready compiled EXECUTABLE file inside the folder "Ready-compiled-exe".

Hopefully you enjoy!


PS. I'm aware the code is spaghetti and not well formatted and so on, but I honestly don't care as this isn't one of my main projects.
