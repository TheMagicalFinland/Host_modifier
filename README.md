# Host_modifier

This application aims at providing assistance with the "hosts" file on your PC and makes it somewhat easier than opening notepad and modifying it manually.

This is a side project and I got the idea of developing it at 21.10.2022.

The code was first kept private, but released to public after requested. (Though it's a .NET project and you can easily reverse engineer the .dll file for the source.)

If you can't compile the program yourself, there is a ready compiled EXECUTABLE file inside the folder "Ready-compiled-exe".

You can test it out and open pull request if you have improvement ideas or would like to re-program my old spaghetti codes.

And for anyone wondering about the code quality of this project, it's not the best, I am aware. I see a lot to improve on myself too. Mainly the cause of this was due to me believing I'd keep the project to myself and not releasing it as an open source project. If you clone the repo, I would highly recommend you to do some improvements on my old codes and open a PR. I will make sure to check it out and merge it with master if it's matching the general programming standards, meaning the code must be clean, readable, secure, bug-free, and efficient.
